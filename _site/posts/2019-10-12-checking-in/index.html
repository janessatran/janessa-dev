    <h2>Checking in again</h2>
<p>Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ It's been about three months since I've posted on this blog, which is quite a bit of time... but not very unusual for me. I haven't prioritized recording the things I've been doing much in blog post form (although, I'm pretty good with <a href="https://twitter.com/janessatran_">tweeting</a> about what I'm learning). A lot has happened during the last time I posted! Exciting things! To name a few:</p>
<ul>
<li>I wrapped up my apprenticeship with RubyMe, contributing to the open source project <a href="https://github.com/ifmeorg/ifme">If me.</a></li>
<li>I started learning ReactJS (in September), going through The Road to React and building <a href="https://protected-fortress-53041.herokuapp.com/">this HackerNews search app</a>) as well as <a href="https://janessatran.github.io/gratitude-list/">this Gratitude List app</a>).</li>
<li>I adopted a kitten, his name is Lloyd.</li>
<li>I got promoted at my current company- but I'm leaving soon because I got a Junior Software Engineering position!!!! (ahhh!!! yay!!)</li>
<li>I started going to Meetups (my goal is at least once per month), which I'm proud of because I tend to have anxiety around traveling alone (I primarily transport by bus).</li>
<li>I participated in Hacktoberfest and made 4 PRs in 4 different open source projects in ReactJS and Ruby on Rails!</li>
</ul>
<p>On top of working full-time, I'm pretty content with what I've been able to accomplish. Outside of coding and learning, I'm also trying to just maintain a balance in my life. I hear that's a good thing (just kidding, I know first hand that it's a good thing, take care of yourselves folks!!!) To me, balance looks like spending quality time with friends and my partner, spending quality time with my cat, exercising a few times a week, and just giving myself the space to just reflect and refactor. So there's been a lot of all that going on in between all the other milestones I just listed.</p>
<p>Anyway, I'm starting a new chapter soon and entering into the world of creating software professionally and I want to get in the habit of writing about what I'm learning/doing/confused about/etcetera, at least once a month. I think it'd be nice to look back on old posts and see how far I've progressed, and hey, maybe it might help someone else too!</p>
