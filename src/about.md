## About Me

âœ¨ I'm a full stack engineer. I'm passionate about using **tech for good** and creative expression. I am also an advocate for early-career devs contributing to open-source projects.

I love creating things- with code, paint, yarn, guitar, words, anything really. I also love sharing my knowledge with others through my blog. When I'm not coding, you can find me running, playing with my cat, or playing the guitar. **Ultimately, curiousity is my compass!**

Other things...

- ðŸ˜„ My Pronouns: She/Her
- âš¡ Fun fact: I am a triplet!

Thank you for visitng my corner of the web- I hope you have a wonderful day!! :-)
